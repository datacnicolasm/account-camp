# Next.js / React conventions
- Prefer **Server Components** by default. Add `"use client"` only when needed (state, effects, browser-only APIs).
- Keep side effects and browser APIs inside client components.
- Prefer `next/link` for navigation and `next/image` for images.

# Folder organization (recommended)
- `src/app/...` routes, layouts, loading/error boundaries.
- `src/components/...` reusable UI components.
- `src/features/<feature>/...` feature modules (components, hooks, services).
- `src/lib/...` shared utilities (api clients, validators, formatting).
- `src/types/...` shared types (only if needed).

# Data & boundaries
- Keep data fetching close to the route (server side), and pass typed props down.
- Avoid calling external services directly from deeply nested UI components.
- Route handlers/actions must validate input (e.g., Zod) and return typed results.

# Accessibility & UX
- Use semantic HTML.
- `aria-label` and other user-facing accessibility labels MUST be in Spanish.
- Loading and empty states must exist and be in Spanish.

# Metadata
- Page titles/descriptions shown to users must be Spanish (LatAm).
- Code that defines metadata remains English.
