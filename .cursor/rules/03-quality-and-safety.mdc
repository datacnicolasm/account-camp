description: Quality bar: linting, tests, PR-ready output, minimal diffs, and documentation hygiene.
globs:

# Output quality bar
- Always produce code that is:
  - Type-safe
  - Lint-clean
  - Consistent with existing project patterns
  - Minimal diff (change only what is necessary)

# Testing approach
- If the repo already has a test framework, add/adjust tests for critical logic.
- If there is no test setup, do not invent a full test suite unless requested; instead, keep logic modular and easily testable.

# Documentation
- Keep README/Docs in the language the repo already uses.
- Code comments remain English.
- UI copy remains Spanish.

# No noisy changes
- Do not reformat unrelated files.
- Do not rename variables/files unless it improves clarity and is consistently applied.
